        <h3>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why:</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite subject as of now is <b>CMSC 12</b>. It was the first CMSC subject that introduced the field of Computer Science to me. I've also learned how to use Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this subject.
        </p>
        <h3>Favorite GE so far and why:</h3>
        <p>
            <b>ARTS 1</b> is my favorite GE so far since it focuses on criticizing art through different perspectives. Even though I am not an artist myself, taking the course/subject ARTS 1 helped me to appreciate art more than I did before.
        </p>
        <h3>Favorite programming language so far and why:</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Python</b> is my favorite programming language so far since it is simpler than other languages that I've learned like C and Java. Moreover, its syntax does not need semicolons (;) and curly brackets ({}) as additional parameters for the program to work properly. In addition, other people even managed to directly copy and paste pseudo-code in python and make the program work because of its simplicity in syntax and implementation.

        <h3>Favorite food:</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite food is <b>Tinolang Manok</b>. My mother cooks Tinola as our dish at home often and I always liked how it tastes.
        </p>
        <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
        <p>
            My hobbies are: <b>Playing video games, playing musical instruments like piano and guitar, and singing</b>
        </p>
        <h3>What was your childhood dream?</h3>
        <p>
            I dreamt of becoming an <b>actor</b> since I had always watched movies with my parents when I was young.
