        <h3>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why:</h3>
        <p>My favorite subject as of now is CMSC 12. It was the first CMSC subject that introduced the field of Computer Science to me. I've also learned how to use Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this subject.</p>
        <h3>Favorite GE so far and why:</h3>
        <p>ARTS 1 is my favorite GE so far since it focuses on criticizing art through different perspectives. Even though I am not an artist myself, taking the course/subject ARTS 1 helped me to appreciate art more than I did before.</p>
        <h3>Favorite programming language so far and why:</h3>
        <p>Python is my favorite programming language so far since it is simpler than other languages that I've learned like C and Java. Moreover, its syntax does not need semicolons (;) and curly brackets ({}) as additional parameters for the program to work properly. In addition, other people even managed to directly copy and paste pseudo-code in python and make the program work because of its simplicity in syntax and implementation. </p>
        <h3>Favorite food:</h3>
        <p>My favorite food is Tinolang Manok. My mother cooks Tinola as our dish at home often and I always liked how it tastes.</p>
